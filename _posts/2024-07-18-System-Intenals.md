### **Understanding System Internals**

When we talk about "system internals," we're referring to the basic components and workings of a computer system, including both hardware and software. 

### **Hardware Components**

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

    It performs mathematical and logical operations and runs programs.

2. **Memory (RAM)**

    Random Access Memory (RAM) is temporary storage that holds data and instructions the CPU is currently using. It clears when the computer is turned off.

3. **Storage (HDD/SSD)**

    * Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Uses spinning disks to store data. It's like a library with physical books.

    * Solid State Drive (SSD): Uses flash memory and is faster than HDDs. It's like an electronic library.

4. **Motherboard**

    The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the components. It has slots for the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and other parts.      

5. **Peripheral Devices**

    These are the external devices you use with your computer, like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, and network interfaces.

### **Operating System (OS)**

    The operating system is the software that manages all the hardware and provides services for running applications. 
    It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.

    * Managing input and output operations.

    * Keeping track of where data is stored in RAM.

    * Managing how data is stored and retrieved from storage devices.

    * To communicate with hardware devices.

**Examples of Popular Operating Systems**

    * Windows: Developed by Microsoft, widely used on personal computers.

    * macOS: Developed by Apple, used on Mac computers.

    * Linux: An open-source OS used on servers and desktops.

    * Android: Based on Linux, used on mobile devices.

    * iOS: Developed by Apple, used on iPhones and iPads.

**Summery**

    The OS is essential for managing the hardware and software resources of a computer. It provides a user interface, manages processes and memory, handles file systems, and controls hardware devices. Understanding these basic points about the OS helps in grasping how computers work and how to interact with them effectively.
