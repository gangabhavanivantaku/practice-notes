### **Basics of Pointers**

* A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. In other words, it "points" to the location in memory where the actual data is stored.

* Declaring Pointers

To declare a pointer, you specify the type of data the pointer will point to, followed by an asterisk (*) and the pointer name.

```c
int *ptr;   // ptr is a pointer to an integer
char *cptr; // cptr is a pointer to a character
```

* Initializing Pointers

Pointers are usually initialized to point to the address of another variable using the address-of operator (&).

```c

int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num; // ptr now points to the address of num
```
**Example program**

```c
#include "stdio.h"

int main(void)
{
    int n = 10;

    // int POINTER ptr = ADDRESS_OF(n)
    int * ptr = &n;
    printf("%i\n", *ptr);

    *ptr = 200;
    printf("%i\n", *ptr);
    printf("%i\n", n);

    n = n+5;
    printf("%i\n", *ptr);
    printf("%i\n", n);
}
```
**The corresponding output**

```bash
10
200
200
205
205
```
